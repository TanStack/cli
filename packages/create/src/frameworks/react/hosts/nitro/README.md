## Deploy with Nitro

This project uses Nitro as a generic server adapter, so it can run on any Node-compatible host.

```bash
npm run build
node dist/server/index.mjs
```

The build output is a self-contained Node server. To deploy, push the `dist/` directory to your host (Render, Fly.io, your own VPS, etc.) and run the server command above.

For host-specific presets (Vercel, Netlify, Cloudflare, AWS Lambda, etc.) and tuning, see https://v3.nitro.build/deploy.
